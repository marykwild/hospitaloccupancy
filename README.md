Covering South Carolina's hospital closures and consolidation begged more information about how full some hospitals were. After some research, I landed on and learned how to utilize the Medicare Cost Reports, which are complex files that required careful reading of documentation.
See an example of how I used the data <a href = "https://www.postandcourier.com/williamburg-and-lake-city-hospitals-arent-staying-full-especially-after-2015-flood/html_fca87b7e-7864-11eb-b4db-4b7d0bccb57c.html"> here, to cover hospitals under threat of closure following damage from a catastrophic storm.</a>
In the first days of coronavirus' arrival, I turned back to this data to <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/health/covid19/coronavirus-may-be-pushing-some-sc-hospitals-closer-to-the-brink/article_b58c6608-737c-11ea-a2b3-930e635ba67a.html"> illustrate where South Carolina's ICU beds are</a> and show which portions of the state lacked coverage.

The cost report data can be downloaded by <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/Cost-Reports/Cost-Reports-by-Fiscal-Year">individual fiscal year here.</a>
