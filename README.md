Covering South Carolina's hospital closures and consolidation begged more information about how full some hospitals were. After some research, I landed on and learned how to utilize the Medicare Cost Reports, which are complex files that required careful reading of documentation.
See an example of how I used the data <a href = "https://www.postandcourier.com/williamburg-and-lake-city-hospitals-arent-staying-full-especially-after-2015-flood/html_fca87b7e-7864-11eb-b4db-4b7d0bccb57c.html"> here, to cover hospitals under threat of closure following damage from a catastrophic storm.</a>
In the first days of coronavirus' arrival, I turned back to this data to <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/health/covid19/coronavirus-may-be-pushing-some-sc-hospitals-closer-to-the-brink/article_b58c6608-737c-11ea-a2b3-930e635ba67a.html"> illustrate where South Carolina's ICU beds are</a> and show which portions of the state lacked coverage.

The cost report data can be downloaded by <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/Cost-Reports/Cost-Reports-by-Fiscal-Year">individual fiscal year here.</a> Once that is done in a local directory, the R script at this repo can be followed. Replace the number in the "grep" statement (42, in South Carolina's case) with the number that corresponds to your state to reproduce the analysis. The easiest way to do this is to look up one Medicare Provider Number for a local hospital you know and look at the first two digits. This number should hold true across your state of interest.
